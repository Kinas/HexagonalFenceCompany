ReactTable
=====================

### What is this?

This application was designed for a presentational purpose. You may see a simple table created with React.js loading JSON data in it. By clickling on a row you will get additional information that the data provides.

In this special case the user can see all the insurances listed with the possiblity to select an insurance and see which insurance categories the selected insurance covers.

### Install with npm

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local workspace

2. Use npm to install the dependencies

`` npm install ``

3. Start the application by running the command:

`` npm start ``

### What still needs to be done

1. Styling! The table looks a little bit too simple and not ready for the 21 century. 

2. Different approach on how the data is displayed: For example not in a table but in a ``<span>``

3. Using more libraries to stop reinventing the wheel. What is already there should be used.
